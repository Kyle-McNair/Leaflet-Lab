            Cities in North America display from little, to hundreds of high rise buildings. While there are no distinct classifications of how tall a skyscraper needs to be, the universal height to be considered a "skyscraper"
            is over 100 meters (~330 feet). This map shows a time series of the amount of high rise structures built in each decade. The time spans from the 1890, all the way to the 2010s (latest year 2019). You will find New York to
            be the dominant home of skyscrapers, but also see trends during certain decades where cities build dozens more as time passes. Not only can the number of these structures portray the population of a city, but also
            tell us when its economy took off or even how certain historical periods (World War II) limited construction of high-rise buildings.
